- Compute Engine VMs
- Managed VMs - A container is portable and isolates the runtime environment from the target machine.

App Engine now offers a second hosting option: Managed VMs. The managed VM hosting environment lets you run App Engine applications on configurable Compute Engine Virtual Machines (VMs). The VM hosting environment offers more flexibility and provides more CPU and memory options.

You can also use Managed VMs to deploy user-configurable custom runtimes, such as for Node.js and other runtimes.
